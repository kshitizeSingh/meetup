Examples of skills include the ability to play music, answer general questions, set an alarm or timer, and more.</p> \n<p>This meetup group is built around creating a community around people who are interested in developing skills for Alexa. We will host both online and offline events where we share our knowledge about building for Alexa. We'd love to hear about your experiences as well. So if you have something to share or want to demo a cool skill that you built, message one of the organizers.</p> \n<p>Check out alexa.design/india to get started.</p>",

Currently we only play at Viman Nagar and are spreading our wings to Baner too. We host four games a week and for at least 90mins each. We also have a watsapp group created which shares the latest updates regarding bookings, game discussions and other game related info. Lastly, we are all amateurs who believe in having fun both On and Off the pitch. So if you're interested, hit the Join Button :-)</p> \n<p>We play on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8pm. We also host weekend games but the timing is not fixed. &lt;br&gt;</p> \n<p>Frequently asked questions:</p> \n<p>1) Are football shoes needed?</p> \n<p>Ans: No, but shoes are compulsory. You may wear any shoes you like.</p> \n<p>2) Is it a paid event?</p> \n<p>Ans: Yes. We divide the ground booking amongst ourselves which is generally 1950/12 = almost Rs. 180. If you are new, you pay in cash at the ground after game.</p> \n<p>3) Location on meetup not perfect?</p> \n<p>Ans: Just search for the location name on Google Maps. For example, search \"The Fortress\" on Google maps.</p> \n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>",

DevSecOps is no different, but DevSecOps recognizes that security is the responsibility of everyone in an organization, and everyone has a role to play in security.</p>\n<p>By including security at every stage of the software delivery lifecycle, the cost of complying with regulation and governance standards is reduced overall and the speed of software delivery is increased. Simultaneously, greater transparency enables superior threat hunting across the board and much more flexible reaction and recovery times.</p>\n<p>No matter how many technologies you implement, the weakest link will always be the human factor.

Our group is very active with meetups happening at least once a week. It is a diverse group with people from all walks of life, united by a passion for gaming! The meetups are free to attend, newbee friendly (you get to learn the rules from the experienced gamers) and fun-filled!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now we have a second group, which will have more events on the eastern side of Pune. Please check the link below and join that group too!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Pune-Fun-and-Strategy-Games-Meetup-Vol-2/\">https://www.meetup.com/Pune-Fun-and-Strategy-Games-Meetup-Vol-2/</a><br></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>The page below shows a list of a few of the games owned by different members of the group:</span><br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Pune-Strategy-Board-Games/pages/24051663/Games/\">https://www.meetup.com/Pune-Strategy-Board-Games/pages/24051663/Games/</a> <br></p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>The group is featured in the media from time to time.

We&nbsp;will also focus on creating career networking opportunities for its members and help them break into this field.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We hope you will find this channel useful for all your Machine Learning endeavours.&nbsp;<br><br></p>\n<p>As with any successful Meetup, our group needs structure in order to perform to the best of its ability. Members and/or Organizers who break the Rules &amp; Code of Conduct may be suspended or removed from our group with or without advance notice.&nbsp;<br><br></p>\n<p>Our Rules &amp; Code of Conduct -&nbsp;<br><br></p>\n<p>1. Please keep your RSVPs current. We do actually put time and dedication into our Meetups, and it is very disappointing to see people reserve seats and not turn up, with no indication of their change of plans. We prefer cancellations to occur a minimum of 12-24 hours in advance. By doing so, this will respectfully give your rsvp replacement adequate time to prepare and plan for the Meetup. We never want to leave a person on the waiting list because you were not able to fill the seat we reserved for you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>2. Please research the Meetup topic before RSVPing to ensure you can obtain maximum benefit from any session. This is your responsibility not ours, although we will be more than happy to answer your questions upfront and help you determine whether the Meetup makes sense for you. If you have any questions, please be vocal on the event listing!<br><br></p>\n<p>3.&nbsp; We will define No-Shows as members who have RSVPed for any event, and haven't turned up without informing us. We have a strict policy around No-Shows.&nbsp; A couple of No-shows against your name and you will be barred from this group.&nbsp;<br><br></p>\n<p>4. For paid events, yes you can pay on the spot via cash/card. All paid events will clearly mention the event fees. Please double-check before RSVPing for a paid event whether the fees are acceptable to you.<br><br></p>\n<p>5. We do not tolerate bad attitudes or opinions that could be hurtful or offensive to our members. You must treat every single person in the group politely and respectfully at all times.</p>\n<p><br>Thats it! Hope all of you have a pleasant experience participating in our Meetups!<br><br></p>\n<p>Cheers</p>\n<p>The CareerTrails Team<br></p>",

	"description": "<p>This is a group for anyone interested in using Java as their primary programming language in a professional setting. All skill levels are welcome. We aim to leverage the know-how and experience of industry veterans to take everyones Java programming skills to the next level. We will explore topics of relevance in great depth - these will range from language/runtime features to important frameworks/libraries/products from the Java ecosystem. There will always be an emphasis on hands-on programming and learning through real-world examples. Looking forward to meet and expand this network of Java enthusiasts in Pune.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We hope you will find this channel useful for all your Java endeavours.<br><br>As with any successful Meetup, our group needs structure in order to perform to the best of its ability. Members and/or Organizers who break the Rules &amp; Code of Conduct may be suspended or removed from our group with or without advance notice.<br><br>Our Rules &amp; Code of Conduct -<br><br>1. Please keep your RSVPs current. We do actually put time and dedication into our Meetups, and it is very disappointing to see people reserve seats and not turn up, with no indication of their change of plans. We prefer cancellations to occur a minimum of 12-24 hours in advance. By doing so, this will respectfully give your rsvp replacement adequate time to prepare and plan for the Meetup. We never want to leave a person on the waiting list because you were not able to fill the seat we reserved for you.<br><br>2. Please research the Meetup topic before RSVPing to ensure you can obtain maximum benefit from any session. This is your responsibility not ours, although we will be more than happy to answer your questions upfront and help you determine whether the Meetup makes sense for you. If you have any questions, please be vocal on the event listing!<br><br>3. We will define No-Shows as members who have RSVPed for any event, and haven't turned up without informing us. We have a strict policy around No-Shows. A couple of No-shows against your name and you will be barred from this group.<br><br>4. For paid events, yes you can pay on the spot via cash/card. All paid events will clearly mention the event fees. Please double-check before RSVPing for a paid event whether the fees are acceptable to you.<br><br>5. We do not tolerate bad attitudes or opinions that could be hurtful or offensive to our members. You must treat every single person in the group politely and respectfully at all times.<br><br>Thats it! Hope all of you have a pleasant experience participating in our Meetups!<br></p>\n<br>",

Typically there are clubs formed at communities, colleges, alumni associations, trade bodies, companies etc. <br> <br><b>What does a club member do?</b> <br> <br>Attend the club meetings, &amp; Follow the guided programme of Toastmasters International in Communication &amp; Leadership. (This has evolved over 90 years of experience.)In addition, experienced members help other club members become better speakers (Mentor them) &amp; help the club in its functioning. <br> <br><b>How receptive is the club to new members?</b> <br> <br>Most people are genuinely terrified of speaking in public or are quite conscious about what the audience might think or say. Toastmasters meetings are totally un-biased and non-judgmental. A visitor will be welcomed enthusiastically into the club and immediately be considered a member of the group.</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p><i><b>Typical Meetings of Toastmasters Clubs</b></i> <br> <br><b>How is a typical meeting conducted? </b> <br> <br>In each meeting, there are 3 sections - <br> <br>One section deals with Impromptu Speaking, second deals with prepared speeches, which are <br>later evaluated, which is the third section. <br> <br><b>What happens in the Impromptu Speaking Section?</b> <br> <br>One member gives away the topics, or \u2018tables\u2019 them one by one, the others can speak on it by either volunteering or once they are nominated. <br>The time allotted is between 1 &amp; 2 minutes <br> <br><b>What happens in the Prepared Speech Section?</b> <br> <br>The members follow a graded programme, as per the manual -- that they receive, once they become members. <br> <br>They deliver speeches on any topic of their choice, but using the suggested format &amp; trying to meet the objectives of that particular speech <br> <br><b>Evaluation Section</b> <br> <br>Later, senior members evaluate these speeches, giving them constructive feedback. <br> <br>This is the best part of the programme- Positive, encouraging feedback with suggestions for improvement! <br> <br>In addition to providing the speaker with feedback the evaluator learns important skills in quickly preparing a presentation and listening skills. One thing to note is that the evaluators evaluate the speech and not the speaker. This is a subtle but important difference. <br> <br>The distinctive feature of Toastmasters is this continual evaluation. Each activity at a club is evaluated: speeches are evaluated both orally at the meeting as well as by writing in the manual. There is language evaluation nearer the end of the meeting. Even the evaluators are themselves evaluated at the end of the meeting by a General Evaluator. <br></p>",

	"description": "<p>Calling all travel lovers to come join us on our adventures. Let's get together for affordable activities in India and around the globe. I myself have travelled to many parts of the world and made several friends along the way. Hence I started this group not only to share my expertise on travel, but to meet new people and help you make the most of your trips.</p>\n<p>The ideal member of this group would be one who is a travel aficionado. Someone who likes to travel in groups, make new friends and who is open to new experiences. There are several reasons why someone should join our group. Most importantly to travel and discover places. With our expertise and knowledge about places around the globe, helps us ensure that people who will travel with us will make the most of their trip. I will make sure that during the trips the travellers will be taught something about the local culture in the midst of which they are. Most importantly once somebody travels with us, he will officially become part of our global travellers network and can make the most of it as well. In the paragraph above I say we because I have done my MBA from Cardiff UK, during which I had the good fortune of making friends from around the world. I myself have travelled to several countries. Hence with the help of my network I will ensure I am able to plan memorable holidays for my members. Members can expect to see great travel destinations and a reasonable price as we will be travelling in groups and make the most of group discounts. We will be exploring the culture of any place we visit, such as museums, local restaurants and other activities which would help learn about the culture. Also a little bit of adventure such as camping, trekking, white water rafting, etc. All these activities will always be planned with reputed organizations, to ensure the safety of the members. Trips will be planned for both India and abroad. Holidays could range from weekend getaways to 2 weeks trips as well. Most importantly members will be not be charged extra for the trips. I have passion to travel and meet new people, so everything will be transparent, booking costs will disclosed to the members. Therefore this group is not created to make money, but is aimed at making a global network of travellers which is a worth a lot more than any monetary value. When you travel with people you get to know them better and this something I have experienced several times. With the help of this group, members will get a chance to interact with people from different walks of life and different ethnic backgrounds. Hence can help people grow their network which in today\u2019s world is priceless. Hence the quote \u201cThe opposite of networking is not working\u201d- Unknown. As an organiser I will make sure that all the travellers get to know each other before the trips and a lot better during the course of the holiday. Getting to know each other activities will be organized before the trip such as lunch, dinner meets or could also just be coffee. Whatsapp, Facebook groups will be created so that people can interact with each other.</p>",

Here is group email id punehomeschoolers@googlegroups.com</p> \n<p>Our childhood and school was full of fun. But we know there is something terribly wrong with our educational system which is highly commercialised, un-ncesessarily competitive, having lots of tests, measuring intelligence ONLY with marks &amp; percentages, having fixed routine &amp; batch system and worst of all having de-motivated teachers... Lets puts children back at the centre of education. Lets explore better ways to schooling.</p> \n<p>Are you frustrated with current education system? &lt;br&gt;Do you feel you never got real education to prepare them for real life? and your kids are NOT getting it either? &lt;br&gt;Do you feel helpless when you are not able to help your kids to deal with new ways of life?</p> \n<p>You want your kids to enjoy school? &lt;br&gt;Do you want to educate your kids to live a responsible life? &lt;br&gt;You want to empower your kids for 21st Century?</p> \n<p>Are you thinking of Unschooling or Homeschooling your children?</p> \n<p>Are you already a practising homeschooling parent?</p> \n<p>Lets start questioning school system and build new one for Curious kids!</p>",

No need to spend thousands on fancy gym ( which gives more injury than health and fitness). No time to waste on stupid treadmill to reduce fat, it can be done by BW (Body Weight) exercise in less time. No need to jog miles and miles ( which in long run bad for your knees), instead it can be replace with Hill sprints in few meters. I started this group because to meet other BW excercise enthusiasts. Looking forward to exploring the BW excercises with everybody.\u201d</p>",

But that does not deter many of us, who are determined to take up a path no matter what. It is still possible to progress.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this group we will share our own knowledge and experiences on how to go ahead all alone, helping yourself, teaching yourself, and tackling the various obstacles that show up on the path.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Senior or experienced members will try to solve the issues being faced by others, suggest solutions or answer questions and doubts of fellow members. I hope this group will be beneficial for all of us, who, while living a materialistic life, feel an urge to take up a spiritual journey.</p>\n<p>All meetings will be totally free of cost.</p>",

	"description": "<p><b>Roaming Clan</b>&nbsp;is a membership-based club/community for individuals who want to travel but they don\u2019t have people to travel with. These individuals come to us as their reach is limited to their friends and family and if their friends and family is not available to travel with them, they have 3 choices:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. Either they can travel solo by themselves and we provide them all the help and support&nbsp; <br>2. They can come to us and we help them in connecting with other similar travellers in our community, who might be interested in travelling with them&nbsp; <br>3. We also have fixed departure curated experiential trips and these individuals can join them as well&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>How do we connect solo-travellers?</b></p>\n<p>1. You can find other roamers through our Roamer's connect forum-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://roamingclan.com/connect-solo-travellers/\">Roamer's Connect</a></p>\n<p>2. You can join&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/roamingclan\">Roaming Clan Facebook Group</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/roamingclan\">Roaming Clan Facebook Page</a></p>\n<p><b> <br></b></p>\n<p><b>Fixed Departure trips:&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>We organise fixed departure trips every month to various destinations around the world. These trips are curated and focussed on giving a fun and unique experience instead of just ticking off places. In most of our trips, there are various adventure activities included in the itinerary for eg, scuba diving, skydiving, surfing lessons, water sports, hiking etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For selecting the candidates in these trips, we invite applications from individuals via different social media platforms and meet-ups. The registration process involves a mandatory telephonic screening. This is to understand why they want to travel with us and to make sure that we have genuine and trust-worthy participants in our trips.</p>",

	"description": "<p>As a coder, We continuously try and motivates other women coder to take up the technical job. As per our recent studies, women are not very inclined to take up the coding job. It's not because they are not capable its because they lack confidence. Many women are more inclined towards their position in starting year and drift because of additional personal responsibilities. our ambition is to change this mindset. You can do all your chores and still be able to work. Many companies these days offer work from home which is changing the dynamics for women. We at Cyphertree are organizing an event oWomaniya which as a hackathon for women in tech. Our mission is to create a portal for Women in Need. It's not a portal to discuss problems, its a gateway to address issues and educate women about their rights and how to handle delicate situations. Especially with the #metoo movement.</p> \n<p>As a coder, we all can come together an develop the digital portal, that can help other women so that the next woman doesn't face the same situation. It's is a very constructive and positive approach to handle situations like; sexual harassment, gender pay gap, pregnancy discrimination, work-life imbalance and so on. As a coder, We feel responsible for building a positive and safe digital world for fellow females.</p> \n<p>What We need is your support. This event is on 16th March 2019 in Viman Nagar, Pune. We are looking for sponsors and host. Cyphertree organizes this event in Pune. Our mission is to run this event across the country on the same day. So we are looking for more host in different cities to run this hackathon (oWomaniya.io)</p> \n<p>Who can participate in this event? Coders (technology agnostic), designer, tester, content writer, social media manager, and lawyers. Create a group of 2-4 and submit proof of the concept during the hackathon. The best three teams will be selected, and their project will be hosted as an open source project so that all other women can contribute to the same.</p> \n<p>It's an excellent opportunity for women who have a gap in their professional life and want to get back in the game.</p>",

(This is when you put on your imagination hat).<br>What if you could bring back the joy you felt as a child when you sketched (come on we all know it was scribbling but it was so much fun).. so when you sketched a house (which was actually a hut) with a backdrop of 3-5 mountains stiched together, with a beautiful view of sun rise (one could never figure out whether the sun rose or set even yet beautiful), with a river originating from the mountain falling into a waterfall and flowing gracefully right next to what we thought was a never ending range of trees and bushes. Well it may sound abit silly now but do you remember how happy you simply were while sketching this? Totally fluttering with excitement!<br>What if creativity was just that! What if creating art is about the fun process of simply doing it and expressing and not the outcome? And what if you did allow yourself to have these moments of simple joy in your life.. what would that change for you?</p>",

	"description": "<p>I'm creating this group for anyone interested in a new emerging technology of robotic process automation. I do believe that in the nearest future this technology will change the paradigm of automation and there will be great increases of efficiency in the companies. Together we will learn what it is, how to work with it and how to get real results for the companies using this technology.<br></p>\n<p><span>Robotic process automation (RPA) is the application of technology that allows employees in a company to configure computer software or a \u201crobot\u201d to capture and interpret existing applications for processing a transaction, manipulating data, triggering responses and communicating with other digital systems.</span><br></p>\n<p>Any company that uses labor on a large scale for general knowledge process work, where people are performing high-volume, highly transactional process functions, will boost their capabilities and save money and time with robotic process automation software.</p>\n<p>RPA helps to augment digital workforce on demand. A workforce that you can teach countless skills. The more it learns, the more efficient it becomes. It works without ever taking a vacation. It can be small one day or large when your business hits a spike. And it frees up your best people to really be your very best people. Meet the Software Robots \u2013 the Digital Workforce.</p>\n<p>The adoption rate of RPA has been gaining momentum over the past two to three years largely due to the increasing attention it has received from tier one consulting firms, and from the increase in IT vendors providing RPA solutions and delivering more sophisticated software. This meetup will provide you an insight into Robotic Process Automation (RPA), tools and its future.</p>",

This group is for all those who are afflicted by this phenomenon, we (if one more person joins me!) will motivate each other to push through the deary web of lethargy and achieve what Leonidas could not accomplish, that is assembling more than 300 people! I invite all to join me in this quest to go beyond fitness and training and find out what happens after a grueling up hill run and a 100 push ups. P.S: since its mandatory to have a singular goal for any kind of quest, i have set a tiny one to compete in an endurance race consisting of 100kms of cycling, 10km of hike n bike, 25km trekking and little bit of an obstacle run. and we have like less than 1-1/2 months to prepare...",
